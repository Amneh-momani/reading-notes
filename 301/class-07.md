# Working with partners

The way I work with partners during pair programming it affects on me but in positive way ,like we can solve many things togather by short time by sharing our knowledge and information so it will give everyone a new info maybe will help him later or to do something that he didn't now .

# Roy Fielding

He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internetâ€¦ and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser

## the techniques that we use today don't work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world

Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of **the techniques** developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.

## the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created is

is all about applying verbs to nouns so when we go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL we typed in and back comes a web page.

## What does a GET do?

  Especially when we're using a web browser because browsers  pretty much just GET stuff and I can GET many things by given a URL like **(images , text, video,mp3)**.

  ## What does a POST do?

 If one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP verb of POST.

 ## What does PUT do?

If a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PUT.

## What does PATCH do?

If a system wants to do a partial update , it uses an HTTP verb of PATCH.
