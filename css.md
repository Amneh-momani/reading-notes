# CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
 Allows you to create **great-looking** web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is, with a simple syntax example, and also covers some key terms about the language.

 
_However_, the web would be a boring place if all websites looked like that. Using **CSS** you can control exactly how HTML elements look in the browser, presenting your markup using whatever design you like.

## CSS syntax
CSS is a rule-based language â€” you define rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page.

The rule opens with a **selector** . This selects the HTML element that we are going to style. In this case we are styling level one headings **(<h1>)**.

We then have a set of curly braces **{ }**. Inside those will be one or more declarations, which take the form of property and value pairs. Each pair specifies a property of the element(s) we are selecting, then a value that we'd like to give the property.

# How To Add CSS
By put this tag in HTML file :
<link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">

# CSS Tools: Reset CSS
The reset styles given here are intentionally very generic. There isn't any default color or background set for the body element, for example. I don't particularly recommend that you just use this in its unaltered state in your own projects. It should be tweaked, edited, extended, and otherwise tuned to match your specific reset baseline. Fill in your preferred colors for the page, links, and so on.
