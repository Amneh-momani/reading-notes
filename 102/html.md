* **note** : the link in the lab of html it didn't  open with me so I'm gonna type what I had learn today.

# HTML
** Stands of (Hyper text markup language)**
_ which means any changed we made in the code it will be visible in the user screen. _

And this language is the structure of any website so it's **impossible** that we create any website without this language. It has many tags and everyone has a unique purpose.
Examples:
+ H1,H2,H3,H4,H5,H6 these tags for the **headlines**.

* *<P>  tag to type any **paragraph** inside HTML file.

+ <a> tag to add any **link** in the website.

+ *<ul> tag which it has many list items **unordered list**.
 
 + and other tags.

But there's a specific tags we use it to the website to decide how the web will look later. These are (**main , section , footer**).
