## There's many remots we can use it in Command Line Interface (CLI).
Here's some examples about it:

* pwd (print working directory)
* ls (to show only avialabel files)
* ls-la (it shows all files)
* mkdir (to create direct for any file)

And we can go directly or create a new file or back to previous folder by other rules .

we can change the code from replit as we used it like a local machine that's mean if we want to change something locally and make it avialabel so this way will helps to do this purpose.
